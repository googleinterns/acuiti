The project involves using shape-context descriptors to search for icons in images.

Shape Context descriptors were introduced in this 2001 research paper from UC Berkeley: https://papers.nips.…ject-recognition.pdf.

The shape context implementation is available in OpenCV: https://docs.opencv.…stanceExtractor.html
